        <p class="blog-h2">The Three D's</p>
        <p class="blog">
          We've evolved to avoid discomfort, difficulty, and dispersion of energy when possible. In the ultra-convenient and cushy lives of the modern world, avoiding these three D's has become the default, to the detriment of our physical, mental/emotional, and social health.

        <p class="blog-h2">Physical Discomfort</p>
        <p class="blog">
          Losing weight and getting into shape are a couple of the most popular new year's resolutions for good reason. Eating less than your current maintenance calories causes extreme discomfort, as your body has adapted to your current diet and caloric intake and dislikes unnecessary change. The act of exercise is also physically uncomfortable, even painful, with micro-tears being a requirement for hypertrophy in order to build muscle mass<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspxLike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup>.

        <p class="blog-h2">Mental and Emotional Discomfort</p>
        <p class="blog">
          Learning to do new things is hard. The reason is because it requires our brain to build new synaptic connections between neurons, which requires (you guessed it) more energy. And on top of that, our emotions can get in the way, which make us more likely to procrastinate<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608016302187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup>. On top of dealing with new learning material, regulating our emotions is also difficult if we are not well-practiced in it. This requires a kind of meta-wiring. You need to teach your brain to become comfortable identifying, processing, and understanding emotions that make you uncomfortable so that you can start the discomfort cycle of learning the new thing.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-h2">Social Discomfort</p>
        <p class="blog">Social discomfort is another form of discomfort that manifests itself mentally, emotionally, and even physically. In fact, social rejection can be felt as physical pain in our bodies<sup><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1102693108" target ="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a><sup>. It's no wonder why dating app usage has skyrocketed or why nearly 77% of the general population fear public speaking<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001270050163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a></sup>. Talking to strangers, even though studies show that it will likely be a positive experience, rather than a predicted negative one<sup><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2020.1816568#abstract" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">5</a></sup>, is a practice that people rarely participate in anymore (at least in bigger metropolitan areas).

        <p class="blog-h2">Ideas for Finding Comfort in Discomfort</p>
        <p class="blog">So how can we find comfort, or even joy, in activities that make us physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially very uncomfortable? The answer is going to be different for everyone for different times and situations, but I will share some ideas:</p>
        <ul class="blog">
          <li>Find a buddy: Having a friend or accountabilibuddy makes most things easier. Examples include exercising with a friend, going to social events with a friend, or body doubling to accomplish emotionally painful tasks you've been procrastinating on</li>
          <li>Find the fun: Ask yourself, what would this activity look like if it were (any semblance or modicum of) fun? Or as Mary Poppins said, "a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down"</li>
          <li>Find mindfulness: Honestly, everything starts with mindfulness. Even becoming aware of your discomfort requires mindfulness. The subsequent confrontation that needs to occur to overcome it (because whatever resists, persists), also requires mindful self-awareness and intent. Mindfulness will help you identify specific times, situations, people, sensory conditions (e.g. lighting) that work for you and energize your versus work against your or drain you.</li>
