        <p class="blog-h2">don't give up</p>
        <p class="blog">For more than 40 years, Bernie Sanders has spoken on the wealth disparity issue in the U.S.<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></sup> that, unfortunately, not only still exists but has gotten considerably worse<sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2</a></sup>. Seeing this kind of unrelenting persistence, untarnished integrity, and realistic optimism for the future inspires me, especially during times like this week. It's tempting to give up and choose the easier option of succumbing to apathy and enjoying a small but hedonistic life while ignoring the dumpster-fire-world around us. But, Nelson Mandela said that change takes centuries not decades. He also said, "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."</p>
        <p class="blog-h2">find your circle of influence</p>
        <p class="blog">
          Following positive psychology's model of the circles of influence<sup><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/circles-of-influence/#understanding-the-theory-a-model-and-diagram" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3</a></sup>, focusing on the things we do have control over will help us to build a sense of agency when feeling a general malaise of hopelessness or discouragement. Our brains have limited mental and emotional capacity to care about a finite number of things. We must first focus on what we can control and expand into things we can and want to influence. I plan to use this model to navigate the new administration, and hope you find this helpful too.
