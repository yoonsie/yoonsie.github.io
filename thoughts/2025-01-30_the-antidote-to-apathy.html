        <p class="blog-h2">Apathy</p>
        <p class="blog">It's easy to fall into apathy, when we are inundated with information beyond what our brains can physically handle<sup><a href="https://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/3/2-3/257.short" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></sup>. The easiest and safest option might be to crawl into a metaphorical (or maybe literal) fetal position and shelter ourselves from the constant tragedies of the world. Although a means of self-protection, can apathy pose a danger to ourselves or others? In the case of memory clinic patients, it poses a 2x risk in incidental dementia<sup><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2687958" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2</a></sup>. And in the case of social situations, the consequences of apathy—in the form of the bystander effect—can be fatal<sup><a href="http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1493/a-summary-of-the-bystander-effect-historical-development-and-relevance-in-the-digital-age" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="blog-h2">Antidote</p>
        <p class="blog">
          Like most things, there is no singular solution for apathy. But, an Australian study on political apathy found that people feel more engaged and less apathetic when having an in-person safe space to speak their views and feel heard<sup><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12015" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">4</a></sup>. Eliasoph's book on political apathy in America supports this finding<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UC5PsXlGBNoC&oi=fnd&pg=PP13&dq=apathy+politics&ots=FEUlFA2Ngv&sig=t9WOjNZPLB0uPuIQgkrbPj8R7oI#v=onepage&q=apathy%20politics&f=false" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">5</a></sup>, as she contends that the best approach is to foster (in-person) open, engaging spaces where people feel empowered to speak, connect, and take collective action.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-h2">Action</p>
        <p class="blog">I'm of the belief that action is the antidote to apathy; of course, along with connection, safety, and other points made by scholars who speak on this topic. However, it all starts from action. The power of momentum cannot be underestimated. For myself, identifying the smallest action that will empower me and quell apathy is my first step. What is yours?</p>
