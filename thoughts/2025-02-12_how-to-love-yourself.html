        <p>Last week I talked about <a href="2025-02-05_why-love-yourself.html" target="_blank">why you should love yourself</a> and today I will share some thoughts and tips on practicing self-compassion based on my personal experiences. I'm no expert in self-love; in fact, I'm quite far from it. But because it was such a challenge, maybe what worked for me may also work for you. So, here's how to love yourself when society and family may have conditioned you otherwise.</p>
        <p class="blog-h2">Mere & Mirror Exposure Effect</p>
        <p class="blog">
          Use a mirror and the mere exposure effect to learn to love yourself. Mere exposure effect refers to the phenomenon for the increased liking of a stimulus following repeated exposure to that stimulus (a.k.a. the familiarity principle)<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></sup>. Since you primarily perceive the world inside-looking-out and rarely perceive yourself (unless you're Narcissus I guess), the advice you may have heard [targeting women] to look in the mirror and say one thing you love about yourself everyday is actually founded in science. It might feel weird at first, but like with all new skills, it will feel less shamefully awkward and more self-affirmative over time. In the wise words of Sheryl Lee Ralph:
          <blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/wjKLI5cbiGc?si=udMSonAWOy9lBY6O&t=96">"People don't have to like you, people don't have to love you, they don't even have to respect you. But when you look in the mirror, you better love what you see."<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/wjKLI5cbiGc?si=udMSonAWOy9lBY6O&t=96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noloop">2</a></sup></blockquote>

        <p class="blog-h2">Know thyself to love thyself</p>
        <p class="blog">
          If you don't really know something or someone and don't fully perceive it in its truest form, do you technically actually love it? You may love a version of it based on your skewed perceptions or projections, but you wouldn't really be loving the subject in its genuine form. Scholars argue that this is the case for the self as well, as self-love requires that you know and understand yourself better<sup><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/knowing-yourself-and-being-worth-knowing/01CC82775BA0D91306B6C04230D5EBEF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3</a></sup>. We can only love ourselves if we know and accept ourselves as we are. And, to know yourself, it all starts with&mdash;unsurprisingly&mdash;mindfulness<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10942-007-0059-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">4</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2013.807353" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">5</a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hwRKCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT4&dq=mindfulness+based+therapy+and+self+love&ots=tVWtPrzXi2&sig=VtXdiWAUnNvs0FYDD_Kuk-IOlds#v=onepage&q=mindfulness%20based%20therapy%20and%20self%20love&f=false" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">6</a></sup>.

        <p class="blog-h2">Show up for yourself</p>
        <p class="blog">
          "You are your own worst critic" is a common phrase that holds true for many. For people with self-critical personalities, hearing generic insubstantial advice telling us we need to be kinder to ourselves because it's good for you<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032722000180" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">7</a></sup> or because you're special or unique are not sufficient motivators. These advice can sound self-delusional and dishonest. Instead, what feels more honest might be to confront your recurring thoughts/behaviors that trigger your vicious cycles of self-loathing. Only then can you identify the core values or expectations that you're failing meet, which then instigate these toxic thought spirals. Once you've identified these values or expectations, you can then devise a plan to show up for yourself. Then, by consistently showing up for yourself, you will internalize that you can rely on yourself, and inevitably, you <em>will</em> start to love yourself. And when you fail&mdash;which, being human, you inevitably will&mdash;every time you get back up and try again, you will learn how resilient you are, which is hard not to love.

I don't want to be anybody else but me. And by knowing this, I want to continue figure out who the fuck I am." <sup><a href="https://youtu.be/RP7bZPFYtMY?si=0IL1JgMU0r_nrABo&t=142" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">8</a></sup>

        <p class="blog-h2">Parent yourself</p>
        <p class="blog">
         Most of us (~62% of American adults), have had adverse childhood experiences<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193602/#:~:text=Results%3A,%25)%20and%20males%20(5.4%25)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">9</a></sup>. Humans are imperfect<sup>no citation needed; just look around</sup>, so it goes without saying that parents will be imperfect. As such, modeling the Internal Family Systems (IFS) psychotherapy appraoch<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">8</a></sup> in order to parent ourselves. Peggy O'Mara said, "the way we talk to our children becomes their inner voice", which certainly was the case for me. By identifying these internalized criticisms from our parents when engaging in our internal dialogues, we can learn to replace them with nurturing self-talk that is consciously and carefully constructed based on our core values<sup><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/peaceful-parents-happy-kids/201905/transform-your-inner-critic-into-your-inner-nurturing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">10</a></sup

        <p class="blog-h2">Confront the odds of your very existence</p>
        <p class="blog">
          Dr. Ali Binazir calculated the odds of any one individual existing<sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2011/11/18/142513598/are-you-totally-improbable-or-totally-inevitable#:~:text=you%20being%20here?-,Author%20and%20blogger%20Dr.,byvisuallyvia" target="_blank" rel=-"noloop noreferrer">11</a></sup> and the result was 1 in 10<sup>2,685,000</sup>, "that's basically zero". He compared it to the odds of two million people rolling a trillion-sided die and all landing on the same number. He considered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The odds of your parents meeting (~1 in 20,000)</li>
            <li>The odds of them having children (~1 in 2,000)</li>
            <li>The odds of the exact sperm and egg meeting (~1 in 400 quadrillion)</li>
            <li>The odds of all your ancestors reproducing successfully for billions of years</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          If we also include the odds of Earth becoming a habitable planet with conditions suitable for complex life, it diminishes further. Some estimates based on Ward and Brownlee's model suggest the odds of an Earth-like planet emerging in the Milky Way are as low as 1 in 10<sup>9</sup> to 1 in 10<sup>12</sup>(meaning at most a handful of such planets in our galaxy)<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243390601_Rare_Earth_Why_Complex_Life_Is_Uncommon_in_the_Universe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">13</a></sup> considering such a planet requires:
          <ul>
            <li>The right distance from a stable star (Goldilocks Zone)</li>
            <li>A large moon to stabilize axial tilt</li>
            <li>Magnetic field to shield from radiation</li>
            <li>Plate tectonics to regulate COâ‚‚ levels</li>
            <li>Presence of water and complex chemistry</li>
          </ul>

          So, it's too late in the night for me to look up peer-reviewed literature on this topic, but the adage that tells people that "you have to love yourself to love others" is utter horseshit. For some of us, it takes being loved to believe that we even deserve love. Mr. Rogers understood that. So here are some Mr. Rogers' videos, shared by a latchkey kid who was partly raised by television shows.
