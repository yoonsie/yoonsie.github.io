        <p>
          When I was younger, I thought our abilities were fixed from birth. You were either born a natural artist or doomed to be terrible at drawing forever. You were born with a mutually exclusive propensity for excelling in either writing or math. You were born bright or born dim.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was indoctrinated into this fixed mindset by my parents, siblings, teachers, media, and society at large.  Had I read Carol Dweck’s book, Mindset<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fT6U0Ee7_kQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=dweck+mindset&ots=kJyMxr9VNg&sig=KVXg96I1E6Nm3kaIgmcjaHHB_zQ#v=onepage&q=dweck%20mindset&f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup>, when it came out in 2006, I would have been able to eradicate these harmful misconceptions and replace them with beliefs founded in a growth mindset much earlier in life.
        </p>
        <p class="blog">
          But, as Dweck purports, even after consciously choosing to adopt a growth mindset, everyone still has certain areas in life that they approach with a fixed mindset. Conscious or not, we hold onto self-limiting beliefs at any point in time; therefore, regular maintenance of exercising mindful awareness and assessment of these beliefs proves necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-h2"><a id="self-limiting_beliefs">Understanding Self-Limiting Beliefs</a></p>
        <p class="blog">
          Self-limiting beliefs typically fall into two high-level categories:
        </p>
        <ul class="blog">
          <li>
            <span class="strong">Information-based</span>: Beliefs stemming from outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate information
            <ul>
              <li>Outdated: Sometimes our beliefs are based on outdated information. Discoveries that upend societal beliefs are regularly made; however, we often don’t update our personal beliefs and perceptions in tandem. We were taught that men were hunters and women were gatherers. That the fastest sperm fertilized the egg. Both were proven to be false in the last couple of years<sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/07/01/1184749528/men-are-hunters-women-are-gatherers-that-was-the-assumption-a-new-study-upends-i#:~:text=A%20new%20reexamination%20of%20ethnographic%20studies%20finds,this%20view%20hasn't%20been%20limited%20to%20academics." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/human-eggs-prefer-some-mens-sperm-over-others-research-shows/#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20by%20researchers,attract%20sperm%20to%20unfertilised%20eggs." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup></li>
              <li>Incomplete: Many aphorisms are often misquoted or omitted: "Jack of all trades, master of none, <span class="italicize">but oftentimes better than master of one</span>"; "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water <span class="italicize">of the womb</span>"; "Curiosity killed the cat, <span class="italicize">but satisfaction brought it back</span>"; "<span class="italicize">The love of</span> money is the root of all evil"; "The ends justify the means, <span class="italicize">but the means are the ends</span>"</li>
              <li>Inaccurate: Sometimes people lie to us, or they feed us misinformation that fosters a self-limiting belief. For example, your metabolism remains generally stable until you turn 60<sup><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/adult-metabolism-remains-stable-until-60-study-reveals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a></sup>, not age 30 like I was told by adults when I was growing up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="strong">Perception-based</span>: Beliefs shaped by how we view our situations, others, or ourselves
            <ul>
              <li>Internal: “I’m not the type of person who can do X"</li>
              <li>Intrapersonal: “If I do X, then I will become happy"</li>
              <li>Interpersonal: “If I fail at doing X, then Y will think I am incompetent"</li>
              <li>External: “I don’t have the time, resources, or abilities to do X"</li>
              <li>Conditional: “If something good happens, something bad always follows"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="blog-h2"><a id="clear_method">The CLEAR Method</a></p>
        <p class="blog">To combat these beliefs, I've come up with an acronym that will help me remember the steps to better identify, evaluate, and replace my self-limiting beliefs:</p>
        <ol class="blog">
          <li>C - Catch the belief when it arises</li>
          <li>L - Label and log the belief</li>
          <li>E - Examine its origin and usefulness</li>
          <li>A - Adjust it or adopt a new belief</li>
          <li>R - Rinse and repeat</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By regularly applying the CLEAR method, I'm hoping I can develop greater self-awareness and consciously choose beliefs that empower rather than restrict me. This method is innately iterative since growth isn't about perfection but persistence</p>
