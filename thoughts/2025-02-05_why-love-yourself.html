        <p>It's February, the month probably most associated with love, so I thought I'd share my personal thoughts on the most important and (hopefully) loving relationship you'll ever have: the one you have with yourself. For years, I kept hearing propaganda about how I should "love myself", but no information on why I should or how I should learn to do it. It took a while, but I finally understand why people keep talking about it (turns out, it is all that it's cracked up to be) and I also finally feel somewhat competent at practicing self-compassion (crazy, right?). And so, I wanted to write about it today and next week. FYI, I will often use "self-compassion" in place of self-love to avoid associations with narcissism or the like<sup><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2021-90865-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></sup>.</p>

          Research-based reasons to love yourself

        <p class="blog">
          You're probably tired of hearing about it. You're probably even sick of seeing it. Especially after companies got their greedy tendrils into it. "Self-love" or "self-care" has reached near "live, laugh, love"-levels of cringe and mass commercialization. But if "self-love" is the cerulean sweater in The Devil Wears Prada<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rDTRuCOs9g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2</a></sup>, then Miranda Priestly represents the scholars who've researched self-compassion and how superior it is to self-punitive habits. Every. Damn. Time.

          Learning and practicing self-compassion will improve your psychological wellbeing. By treating yourself with kindness, recognizing your shared humanity, and being mindful when considering negative aspects of yourself, self-compassion provides greater emotional resilience<sup><a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00330.x" target="_blank" rel="noloop noreferrer">3</a></sup> as well as better achievement motivation<sup><a href="https://sciencescholar.us/journal/index.php/ijhs/article/view/7013" target="_blank" rel="noloop noreferrer">4</a></sup>. It's also found to benefit physical health, with diabetes patients reporting reduced depression, distress, and even clinically meaningful reductions in blood sugar<sup><a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-032420-031047" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noreferrer">5</a></sup>. And finally, to no surprise&mdash;since Buddhists like Thich Nhat Hanh have been saying this for a while&mdash;but self-compassion improves your relationship with others<sup><a href="https://sciencescholar.us/journal/index.php/ijhs/article/view/7013" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noreferrer">4</a></sup> and the world in general<sup>citation needed</sup>. And, as the Grant Study has already basically ~*proven*~, the best thing you can do for your longevity is actually to cultivate your relationships with others<sup><a href="https://openurl.ebsco.com/openurl?sid=ebsco:plink:scholar&id=ebsco:gcd:169717396&crl=c" target="_blank" rel="noloop noreferrer">5</a></sup> (yeah that's right, fk off kale).

        <p class="blog-h2">Somewhat philosophical reasons to love yourself</p>
        <p class="blog">I really enjoyed Matt Hussey's newest book, Love Life. It's basically a therapeutic mindfulness-based book disguised as a "self-love" or "self-development" type of book. In it, he writes about <em>why</em> you should love yourself. His reasoning into this conclusion is quite interesting as it's founded on the question of why people love their family. Why do you love your parents? Children? Or even your pets? The reason he gets from friends isn't "because they're smart" or "because they're cute" (and hopefully those aren't your main reasons either), but because they're <em>theirs</em>. In that same vein, he concludes that we should treat ourselves the same way. You should learn to love yourself, because you're <em>yours</em>. And you were born as the sole being responsible for taking care of You. I thought it was profound. Also, my therapist says that if you have a higher-level belief that all beings have value (which I do), then you, by existence have value and deserve love. These are the sentiments that resonated with me. I encourage you to find yours if they don't resonate with you personally.</p>
